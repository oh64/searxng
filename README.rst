Custom SearXNG
==============

This is a **custom fork of SearXNG**, a privacy‑respecting, hackable
`metasearch engine`_.

**Because I like SearXNG, I add whatever I want on it.**
This code runs on my own instance : https://search.oh64.moe if you want to try it.

The privacy‑respecting aspect is preserved here too:

- No tracking code is added.
- I make sure all my modifications respect your privacy.
- My instance does not keep any logs (not directly related to this code, but see https://oh64.moe/Search-Privacy.html).

I will try to keep this fork updated with the original SearXNG as much as possible.

This fork is based on the original https://github.com/searxng/searxng
project. For general documentation (installation, configuration, contributing)
please refer to the official docs: https://docs.searxng.org/.
